There are several neat features that are included too:\r\n\r\n+ GitHub flavored Markdown Preview\r\n\r\n+ Material Design Hex Color Palette\r\n\r\n+ Save Commands and Easily Run Them\r\n\r\n+ And More (check out the [wiki](https://github.com/xharris/blanke/wiki))\r\n\r\n### Is this project done?\r\nI would say it's in a beta stage. It is usable and if a bug pops (which is very rare), it will not affect your work. Unless you forget to save... then that's your problem.\r\n\r\n### I want to download and run this. How?\r\nAt the moment, there are working builds for the following systems:\r\n\r\n> Windows 7+ (32-bit, 64-bit)\r\n\r\nAvailable but not officially built:\r\n> Mac OS 10.9+\r\n\r\n> Ubuntu 12.04+\r\n\r\n> Fedora 21\r\n\r\n> Debian 8\r\n\r\n### Will this stay open source?\r\nProbably.",
